This is a text file that contains some data. It's primarily meant to test the capabilities of the fifth programming assignment for CSCI 2530, Data Abstraction and Object-Oriented Data Structures. The programming assignmented was coded by Matthew Morgan, and was submitted during the Fall 2017 semester. The instructor was fairly okay, giving challenging, and innovative, assignments to the students. The course reiterated over some previously studied structures, but also introduced new ones. The original text files for this assignment were a book in text format, and are not being provided in favor of avoiding copyright infringement. As such, this text file was provided, and contains random content that is meant to test the assignment's ability to pick up the n most frequent words. The program accepts two parameters - one that specifies the number of words to be shown, and another that redirects the program to the file where input will be accepted from. There is no special format for these files, as any random set of text, such as this file, will do perfectly fine. Two alternative versions of the assignment had to be made - one that uses a list structure, and another that uses a hashtable and collection object to sort the table. The program was written in the Java language, and was fairly interesting to create; however, learning to use the classpath feature of Java to compile and run the program was fairly difficult at the time of the assignment's programming. Needless to say, I did well in the course, and passed with a great grade, as I heavily enjoy programming assignments and challenges of the programming nature.
