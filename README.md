## Course Information
<b>Semester Taken:</b> Fall 2017 <br/>
<b>Code, Name:</b> CSCI 2540, Data Abstraction and Object-Oriented Data Structures <br/>
<b>Instructor:</b> Ronnie Smith <br/>
<b>Language(s):</b> Java <br />

Description: <br/>
Data Abstraction, instructed by Dr. Smith, reiterated the different data structures presented in Algorithms and Data Structures in the Java programming language; however, it also introduced a couple of other data structures, such as regular queues, 2-3 trees, and further exploration into hashtables. Different operations for each of the structures was provided, and an introduction to the Java API also given. Object-oriented programming and class inheritance was introduced, and further elaboration on importing resources via Java explored. (This course had a major focus on abstracting data into various structures, all of which were represented via Java classes. Interfaces were introduced, and elaboration about the differences between public, private, and protected in the language explored.) <br/>
